## What does Sun Devil Rocketry do?
We are currently developing three rocket engines. A solid fuel, liquid fuel, and hybrid engine. Our foundations are as a research and development club. Currently, we are focused on creating a hands-on learning environment for anyone interested in aerospace by developing launch systems that reach around 10,000 ft.

## What is this GitHub for?
This GitHub is the base of operations for the avionics subteam. We focus on supporting the hardware and software needs of the engine subteams. Currently, we're working on a [custom flight computer](https://github.com/SunDevilRocketry/Flight-Computer) and its [firmware](https://github.com/SunDevilRocketry/Flight-Computer-Firmware). Additionally, we hope to create a [desktop application](https://github.com/SunDevilRocketry/polaris) to interact with the flight computer.

## How do I reach out?
If you're an ASU student interested in working with the club, you can find more information on [Sun Devil Sync](https://asu.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/sun-devil-rocketry). If you're an organization or individual interested in sponsoring or learning more about the club, you can reach us at rocketry.asu@gmail.com.
