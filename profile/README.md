## What does Sun Devil Rocketry do?
We have our hands in all sorts of projects related to high power rocketry and rocket propulsion. Some of our recent and upcoming projects include our liquid engine, a two-stage high-altitude rocket, and an active roll control research rocket. We also offer a program for individuals who are new to amateur rocketry to work on a team to design and build their first rocket and we do outreach events at schools in Maricopa County.

## What is this GitHub for?
This GitHub is the base of operations for the avionics team. We focus on supporting the advanced high power rocketry and liquids teams by delivering custom microcontrollers to support their needs. We are split into three subteams:

### Hardware
The hardware division designs and builds custom PCBs to support the club's needs. Their most notable projects include the [Flight Computer](https://github.com/SunDevilRocketry/Flight-Computer), [Liquid Engine Controller](https://github.com/SunDevilRocketry/Liquid-Engine-Controller), and the [Valve Controller](https://github.com/SunDevilRocketry/Valve-Controller). They are also currently working on the latest iteration of the Flight Computer: [Rev 3](https://github.com/SunDevilRocketry/Flight-Computer-R3).
### Firmware
The firmware division is responsible for all of the code that runs on SDR's custom hardware. Their most known project is the [firmware for the Flight Computer](https://github.com/SunDevilRocketry/Flight-Computer-Firmware), but they also have a [ground station](https://github.com/SunDevilRocketry/Ground-Station-Firmware) for wireless telemetry, maintain a [command line interface](https://github.com/SunDevilRocketry/sdec) for SDR boards, and assist with [liquids](https://github.com/SunDevilRocketry/Engine-Controller-Firmware) when needed.
### Software
The software division is responsible for SDR's newest projects. They are currently working on developing an [application to interface with the flight computer](https://github.com/SunDevilRocketry/Flight-Software-GUI), [drivers for industry grade DAQ hardware like the Labjack T7](https://github.com/SunDevilRocketry/Linux-DAQ-Driver), and a rework of [SDEC](https://github.com/SunDevilRocketry/SDECv2) using proper object oriented design principles.

## How do I reach out?
If you're an ASU student interested in working with the club, you can find more information on [Sun Devil Central](https://sundevilcentral.eoss.asu.edu/SDRocketry/club_signup). If you're an organization or individual interested in sponsoring or learning more about the club, you can reach us at rocketry.asu@gmail.com.

Once you're in, contact the avionics team on Slack (`#avionics`).
