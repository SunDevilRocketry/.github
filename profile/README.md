## What does Sun Devil Rocketry do?
We have our hands in all sorts of projects related to high power rocketry and rocket propulsion. Some of our recent and upcoming projects include our liquid engine, a two-stage high-altitude rocket, and an active roll control research rocket. We also offer a program for individuals who are new to amateur rocketry to work on a team to design and build their first rocket and we do outreach events at schools in Maricopa County.

## What is this GitHub for?
This GitHub is the base of operations for the avionics team. We focus on supporting the advanced high power rocketry and liquids teams by delivering custom microcontrollers to support their needs. We are split into four subteams:

### Hardware
The hardware subteam designs and builds custom PCBs to support the club's needs. Their most notable projects include the [Flight Computer](https://github.com/SunDevilRocketry/Flight-Computer), [Liquid Engine Controller](https://github.com/SunDevilRocketry/Liquid-Engine-Controller), and the [Valve Controller](https://github.com/SunDevilRocketry/Valve-Controller). They are also currently working on the latest iteration of the Flight Computer: [Rev 3](https://github.com/SunDevilRocketry/Flight-Computer-R3).
### Firmware
The firmware subteam is responsible for all of the code that runs on SDR hardware. Their most known project is the [firmware for the Flight Computer](https://github.com/SunDevilRocketry/Flight-Computer-Firmware), but they also maintain a [command line interface](https://github.com/SunDevilRocketry/sdec) for SDR boards and assist with [liquids](https://github.com/SunDevilRocketry/Engine-Controller-Firmware) when needed.
### Software
The software subteam is the newest team at SDR. They are currently working on developing a [software application](https://github.com/SunDevilRocketry/Flight-Software-GUI) to interface with the flight computer.
### Liquids
The liquids subteam does everything the other three subteams do, but specifically in support of the Liquid Engine. Both of the hardware platforms for liquids ([Liquid Engine Controller](https://github.com/SunDevilRocketry/Liquid-Engine-Controller) and [Valve Controller](https://github.com/SunDevilRocketry/Valve-Controller)) are also maintained by liquids, plus the [firmware](https://github.com/SunDevilRocketry/Engine-Controller-Firmware) and [software](https://github.com/SunDevilRocketry/liquid_engine_gui) for those platforms.

## How do I reach out?
If you're an ASU student interested in working with the club, you can find more information on [Sun Devil Sync](https://asu.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/sun-devil-rocketry). If you're an organization or individual interested in sponsoring or learning more about the club, you can reach us at rocketry.asu@gmail.com.
